SYLLABUS

Month / Year: March/2022

I.  Course Description
 It is evident that many churches in America, particularly those seeking to reach the
unchurched while staying culturally relevant, are reluctant to use traditional theological terms that capture important facets of salvation. In this course the students will examine the significance of these terms so as to better understand the salvific process for themselves.

II.  Course Learning Objectives
 A student who successfully complete this course will be able to:
(1) First, understand for him or herself, and then be able to explain to others the
following theological concepts: depravity of man, regeneration, justification,
 redemption, predestination, and sanctification
(2) Second, provide adequate answers to difficult questions that rise from these
  theological ideas that run counter to human understanding

III.  Textbooks

- Soteriology I
- Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God (J.I. Packer, InterVarsity)
-What Saint Paul Really Said (N.T. Wright, William B. Eerdmans)
