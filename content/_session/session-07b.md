## Chapter 6: Predestination (Part A)

Predestination means that eternal destination of people is already decided by God even before they are born into the world; what determines the predestination is God’s election. The real conflict boils down to the basis behind God’s election: God’s eternal decree or God’s foreknowledge.

## I. The Two Conflicting Positions regarding Predestination

### A. French theologian John Calvin’s (1509-64) view on predestination and election

1. The sinners’ response of faith and repentance were the result of God’s prior electing grace; that is, God predisposed their wills to respond to His call.

   - Salvation, therefore, is a matter of divine election apart from human merit or divine knowledge; it was decided before anything humans did or did not do.

   - In this way, election is based on the sovereign will of God.

     That is, he didn’t choose to believe; rather, he predetermined to do so.

   - Some Calvinists uphold a dual predestination of some to salvation and others to condemnation.

2. Supporting passages for the unconditional election of Calvinism:

   `Eph. 1:4-5`:
   > For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—.

   `Rom. 9:6-7, 14-5`:
   > It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, ‘It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.

   > …What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For he says to Moses, ‘I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.’

   `John 6:65, 37`:
   > [Jesus] went on to say, ‘This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him …All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.’

   `2 Tim 1:9`:
   > God …has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time.

3. There are several problems, real or imagined, with this view:

   - God’s election seems quite arbitrary

   - It impairs human free will.

   - No verse in the Scripture states that God makes some people incapable of believing, on account that they are not elected for salvation.

### B. A counter view proposed by Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609)

This Dutch theologian broke away from Calvinism because he felt that predestination (inferring that the unelected be damned to hell) made God the author of sin; regardless, he rejected neither predestination nor election.

1. The basis of election.

   > Though he did not deny election he based it not on a divine arbitrary decree, but upon God's foreknowledge of man's merit.

   - In Calvinism, God’s electing grace is based on his unilateral decree (Eph. 1:11) that prompts a response of faith among the chosen and their turning to God;

      1 Peter 1:2, however, seems to back Arminius’ view: “To God’s elect…  who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God.”

      1. The word “foreknowledge” derives from a compound Greek word of pro (in front of) and gnosis (knowledge).

      2. Its implication:

         God, “foreseeing [men’s] potential faith and the fact that they would turn to Him when they heard the gospel,” sealed their response with election.”

   - Despite this difference, those who categorically accuse Arminianism of humanism should know how similar Calvinism and Arminianism are, at least at the outset. In fact, it was Arminius who made the following statement:

     > That God, by an eternal and unchangeable purpose in Jesus Christ his son, before the foundation of the world were laid, determined to save, out of the human race which had fallen into sin, in Christ, for Christ's sake and through Christ, those who through the grace of the Holy Spirit shall believe on the same his Son….

2. Supporting passages for Arminianism.

   `Acts 13:39`:
   > Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.

   `John 6:40`:
   > For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I’ll raise him up at the last day

   `2 Pet. 3:9`:
   > The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

   `Tit. 2:11`:
   > For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.

   `1 Tim. 4:10b`:
   > We trust in the living God, who is the savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

3. This view also has some problems, real or imagined.

   - Salvation seems to be a result of human decision.

   - Difficult to see why the term “election” is used since God merely seals what humans have decided.

### Discussion:

How do you personally feel about this issue that has often resulted in heated discussions between passionate Calvinists and Arminians? What would Jesus, who prayed that “all of them may be one” and “be brought to complete unity” (Jn. 17:21, 23), say to them?

## Homework 7

Read over the material covered in the last class and the additional Bible reading (if any). If you have any questions, please note them here and ask me later.

1. Define “unconditional election” and “predestination” according to Calvinism. Provide at least two supporting verses for this position.

2. What is God’s foreknowledge and how do Arminians use it to back up their understanding of God’s election?
